Hey Christina!

<br><br>. When Zach called me a while ago to talk about bringing you onto the team, I was psyched. Your track record as a professional spoke for itself, you had amazing potential to bring some much needed direction to the team, and you sounded like a perfect fit. You have done— and been—all of that and more. May your birthday today be as exceptional as you are, I’m excited to work together more in the future.

<br><br>Michael
