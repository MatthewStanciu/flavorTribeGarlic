Happy Birthday Christina!

<br><br>I want to thank you for being such a great mentor and colleague this summer. You’ve guided and supported me throughout my time working at Hack Club 
which has been the greatest experience. You’re someone I look up to also for your work and influence outside of Hack Club. Thank you so much for the patience,

<p>Happy birthday Christina!</p>

<p>Since you joined in February, Hack Club started to never be the same. The relentlessness, kindness, and thoughtful leadership you've brought to Hack Club make us better every day.</p>

<p>I can't think of a better person to be running this org with. I'm so glad to have you as a teammate and as a friend.</p>
