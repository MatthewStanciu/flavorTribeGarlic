Happy Birthday Christina!

<br><br>I want to thank you for being such a great mentor and colleague this summer. You’ve guided and supported me throughout my time working at Hack Club 
which has been the greatest experience. You’re someone I look up to also for your work and influence outside of Hack Club. Thank you so much for the patience, 
advice, and encouragement that you’ve given me.

<br><br>Dina
