
Happy Birthday Christina!

<br><br>I want to thank you for being such a great mentor and colleague this summer. You’ve guided and supported me throughout my time working at Hack Club
which has been the greatest experience. You’re someone I look up to also for your work and influence outside of Hack Club. Thank you so much for the patience,
advice, and encouragement that you’ve given me.

<br><br>Happy Birthday Christina! I feel so fortunate that I met you this summer. You have been a great role model to me and I’m forever grateful. I hope this year is the best year yet.
